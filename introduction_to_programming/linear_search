The ages of 15 workers are to be collected. Write a pseudocode program to do the following:
a.    Accept and store the ages into an array called workers_ages    
b.    Find and print the largest and smallest age stored in the array workers_ages         
c.    Find and print the average of the even ages in the array workers_ages

START 
Declare workers_age (14) as Integer 
 total_even_ages = 0
 Largest_age =-1
 Smallest_age=999
   

For count = 0 to 14 do
Print "Enter Workers age"
read works_age [count]
Endfor 
   

for count = 0 to 14 do 
if(workers_age[count]> Largest_age) then
Largest_age = workers_age[count]

ENDIF

if(workers_age[count]> smallest_age)then
smallest_age = workers_age[count]
 
ENDIF
Endfor

for count = 0 to 14 do
if(workers_age[count] modulo 2 == 0)then 
total_even_ages = total_even_ages + workers_ages[count]

Endif
Endfor

if (total_even_ages>0)then
average= total_even_ages/count
ENDIF
print" Largest age is ", Largest_age
print" Smallest age is", smallest_age
print" Average is", average
